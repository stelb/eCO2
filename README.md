# eCO2 Sensor with SGP30 and M5Stamp C3

- platformio project
- color codes for eCO2 Values: green, greenyellow, yellow, orange, red (i think I will change this to blinking instead)
- first baselines will be saved after 12 hours and then every hour as preferences
- as stamp c3 is not supported directly by platformio, needed config is in platformio.ini

## TODO
- wifi
- OTA updating
- expose data for scraping and graphing
